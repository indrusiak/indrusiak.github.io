This is my first blog post in more than a year, and the first one in my new webpage. I moved to the University of Leeds in Aug 2023, and used [the last post of my former blog](https://embeddedoutthere.blogspot.com/2023/08/some-things-should-be-simple-even-end.html) to wrap up my tenure at the University of York. In the meantime, I've settled down at the new job in Leeds, made myself at home with my new [teaching](/teaching) and administrative duties, gave an [inaugural talk](https://mymedia.leeds.ac.uk/Mediasite/Channel/engineering1/watch/5d7cdb6114064755a88c8a3e4d85dd131d), obtained some [external funding](/research) and recruited [two new PhD students](/team). I will write more detailed posts about many of those activities soon, but for now this will serve as a placeholder and as a link to [my former blog](https://embeddedoutthere.blogspot.com/).
