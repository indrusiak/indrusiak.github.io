This is my first blog post in more than a year, and the first one in my new webpage. I moved to the University of Leeds in Aug 2023, and used my last post of my former blog to wrap up my tenure at the University of York. In the meantime, I've settled down at the new job in Leeds, made myself at home with my new teaching and administrative duties, obtained some external funding and hired two new PhD students. I will write more detailed posts about many of those activities soon, but for now this will serve as a placeholder and as a link to [my former blog](https://embeddedoutthere.blogspot.com/).
